          the old code lines, commented out.    SG - 08/08/01

Sam and Ze'ev,

The example in the $$$DOC member requires two changes to work properly:

    Line "000610  01  length-of-current-string pic s(4) comp." should be
changed to:
    Line "000610  01  length-of-current-string pic s(4) comp value 19."

    Line "005600  compute ws-point = max-length-of-string - ws-value + 1."
should be changed to:
    Line "005600  compute ws-point = max-length-of-string -
length-of-current-string + 1."

or  a less clear alternative would be "compute ws-point = 1 - ws-value."
